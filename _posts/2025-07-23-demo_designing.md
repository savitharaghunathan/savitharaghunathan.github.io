## Introduction

Over the past year, I've built demos and experiments to showcase the real impact of projects I work on. Along the way, I learned that the difference between a forgettable demo and one that wins hearts often comes down to **scenario design**.

A great demo doesn't just show what your tool *can* do—it tells a story that resonates with your audience's actual pain points. In this post, I'll share five common pitfalls I've encountered (and fallen into myself), plus the practical strategies that turn demos into compelling, reliable stories anyone can follow.


## Pitfall #1: Ignoring Real-World Context

**What goes wrong:** You grab a tiny code snippet—maybe a toy "HelloWorld" method—and show off a neat transformation. Your audience immediately spots it's artificial and tunes out.

**The reality:** Real problems are messy. They involve legacy code, complex configurations, and edge cases that don't fit into clean examples.

### Best Practices:

1. **Start with actual pain points.** Talk to your team members or analyze support tickets. What frustrates them daily?
2. **Mirror production complexity.** Use real code patterns, complete with logging, tests, and configurations.
3. **Frame the narrative.** Open by describing the actual frustration: *"Every deployment, we hit this same configuration mismatch that takes hours to debug..."*

### Real Example:
Instead of: *"Let's change `foo()` to `bar()`"*

Try: *"Our team spends 3-4 hours every week updating logging calls across services to use our unified logger API. Let's see how we can automate this."*


## Pitfall #2: Overly Broad or Murky Scope

**What goes wrong:** You try to show everything that your project is capable of in one demo. Users can't tell which parts your tool solved or what problems it addressed.

**The reality:** Focus beats comprehensiveness. One clear, well-executed scenario is more memorable than five rushed ones.

### Best Practices:

- **Define one clear goal.** If you're highlighting automated test updates, focus solely on that.
- **Time-box the demo.** Keep it under 8 minutes—attention spans are short.
- **Set explicit boundaries.** *"In this scenario, we'll only touch these three packages and update deprecated API calls."*

### Pro Tip:
Create a simple slide showing "Before" and "After" or "Start" and "End" states. This keeps both you and your audience focused on the specific transformation.


## Pitfall #3: Overlooking Environment & Configuration Quirks

**What goes wrong:** Your demo works perfectly on your laptop, but when someone else tries to run it, they hit missing properties, failing tests, or unmocked services—and blame your project.

**The reality:** Environment differences can derail demos more quickly than any technical bug.

### Best Practices:

1. **Bundle everything.** Include sample YAML/JSON settings, build files, and Docker configurations.
2. **Mock external dependencies.** Stub databases, APIs, or message queues so the demo never breaks.
3. **Automate setup.** Create a shell script or build task that installs dependencies and starts mocks.

### Quick Win:
Version your demo repo with a `setup.sh` script. When you say "works for me," it should truly mean "works for everyone."


## Pitfall #4: Under-Defining Success Metrics

**What goes wrong:** You declare "it succeeded" and move on. Without concrete numbers, there's no way to prove improvement or compare against manual effort.

**The reality:** Numbers tell stories that words can't. They turn anecdotes into evidence.

### Best Practices:

- **Pick quantitative measures:** Time elapsed, number of changes applied, test pass rates, security warnings eliminated.
- **Record a baseline:** Manually perform the same task once—you'll be surprised how long it really takes.
- **Share visual results:** A simple chart or table in your slide deck makes the improvement undeniable.

### Example Metrics:
*"Automated API updates completed in 2 minutes vs. 15 minutes manually—an 87% reduction in effort."*

## Pitfall #5: Skipping the Iteration Loop

**What goes wrong:** You run the scenario once, it works, and you call it done. But demos rarely survive code changes or varied environments on the first try.

**The reality:** A demo that works 90% of the time is worse than one that works 100% of the time.

### Best Practices:

1. **Repeat runs.** Execute the same scenario several times to catch intermittent failures.
2. **Solicit peer feedback.** Share with a colleague early. They will spot assumptions you've missed.
3. **Refine until bullet-proof.** Update your scripts, mocks, or even the demo code until it's rock-solid.

### Reminder:
A demo that always works is far more persuasive than a flashy one-off success.

## Bonus: Define a Clear Call to Action

**Why it matters:** After you've built interest, you need to turn passive viewers into active participants.

### Best Practices:

1. **Spell out next steps.** Tell your audience exactly what you want them to do next.
2. **Provide concrete actions.** *"Clone this repo and run `./setup.sh && demo.sh`"* or *"Install the extension from the marketplace here."*
3. **Offer support.** Suggest a mechanism to follow-up or share feedback.

### Examples:
- *"You can run this demo yourself at `github.com/your-org/demo-scenarios`"*
- *"Install our CLI from npm with `npm install -g my-tool`"*
- *"Let's schedule a quick call to see how this applies to your codebase—pick a time here."*

## Demo Design Checklist

Use this checklist every time you craft a new demo scenario:

- [ ] **Authentic starting point:** Scenario is grounded in a real pain point
- [ ] **Focused scope:** One clear objective, time-boxed under 8 minutes
- [ ] **Stable environment:** All configs, mocks, and setup scripts included
- [ ] **Defined metrics:** Baseline vs. automated comparison outlined
- [ ] **Iteration complete:** Multiple successful runs and peer-reviewed
- [ ] **Clear call to action:** Next steps defined and linked


## Conclusion

Designing effective demos takes as much care as writing production code. By avoiding these five pitfalls, iterating thoroughly, and ending with a crystal-clear call to action, you'll create scenarios that not only work flawlessly but also drive real engagement.
